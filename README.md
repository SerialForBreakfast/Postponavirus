A Public Health tool for Encouraging Users to avoid Face-Touching in times of pandemic(Coronavirus Mitigation) using Machine Learning.

# About
This project seeks to help users practice behaviors that limit the transmission of pathogens that occur via hand-to-face contact.
Face touching (particularly of the mouth, nose, and eyes) can lead to an increased probability of infection from vaious microorganisms.
By using trained pose-detection models that detect these behaviors, we can notify the user of unwanted actions, allowing them to improve their behavior patterns.  
The process of Operant Conditioning can slowly change behaviors over time and lead to better health outcomes.
